# PhotoUploader
iOS app to upload pictures to AWS S3. Developed in Swift as a learning project

Apologies for the lack of documentation. If I get the time I'll try to clean up the code a little bit and make this a little more useful for anyone wanting to know how to upload a photo to AWS S3 like I do.

If you have any questions or if anything is broken, feel free to [ping me](mailto:jcano001@ucr.edu) or submit a pull request!
